            <div className="Message-phi Second-phi"> Although "Creative Director & Developer" may sound like an oxymoron (at least, to me it did), I realized my skillset has been defined by that very role. </div>
            <div className="SVG Three-phi"> </div>

            <div className="Message-phi Third-phi"> Blending film and computer science, we can create beautiful and meaningful UI that improves our collective experiences through narrative. </div>
            <div className="SVG Four-phi"> </div>

            <div className="Message-phi Final-phi"> I'm passionate about using my knowledge of art and technology to create innovative solutions and working with a team to explore modern approaches for supporting artistic expression. </div>
